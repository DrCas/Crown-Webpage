Crown Graphics — MASTER PROJECT CONTEXT

(Authoritative / Replaces all prior chats)

1. Project Overview

Crown Graphics website is currently a static HTML / CSS / JS site.

The site is a visual and UX prototype of the production CrownGFX site.

Backend functionality (orders, email, admin, payments) is intentionally separated and introduced incrementally.

Raspberry Pi is used for development/testing, but production hosting will be web-based.

GitHub (public) is the single source of truth for code.

2. Tech Stack (Current & Planned)
Frontend (Live Today)

HTML5

CSS3 (single unified styles.css)

Vanilla JavaScript

Google Fonts (Poppins)

Google Maps embed

Backend (Designed / Partially Built)

Python Flask

SQLite (Pi-friendly, intentional)

Cloudflare Tunnel (admin access)

Dummy email system → real provider later

Stripe planned for payments

3. Global Design & UX Rules (Locked)
Branding

Color palette: Black / White / Gold accent

Font: Poppins (global)

Images: WebP preferred for all photography

Logos/UI assets may remain PNG/SVG

Header & Navigation

Sticky black header on all pages

Logo is image-based (not text)

Consistent navigation across all pages

Mobile nav is stacked (no hamburger yet)

Background Handling

Same background image applied to both html and body

Mobile uses background-attachment: scroll

Prevents white flashes and black gaps

4. Glass / Panel System (Very Important – Finalized)
Single Source of Truth

.glass is the only class that defines:

background color

shadow

blur / surface effect

No other class may redefine these properties.

Glass Style (Final)

Light neutral grey surface

Subtle blur (or none if unsupported)

Rounded corners

Soft elevation shadow

No heavy blur, no glow, no dark tint

Usage Rules

Apply .glass directly to the visual panel

Never nest glass inside glass

Layout/helper classes must NOT style panels

✅ Correct:

<section class="container readable glass">


❌ Incorrect:

.readable.glass { background: ... }

5. Pages & Features (Consolidated)
Home (index.html)

Hero section with:

Background image

Logo

Headline

CTA → Contact

Services grid:

Vehicle Wraps

Signs & Banners

Custom Decals

Each service requires a matching image asset

About (about.html)

Single centered glass panel

Large readable typography

Banner header with gradient overlay

No additional decorative panels

Contact (contact.html)

Desktop: two-column layout

Mobile: stacked

Independent glass panels:

Intro text

Contact form

Map + business info

Google Maps embed:

13766 Redwood St, Chino, CA 91710

Contact form:

mailto: only (temporary, unreliable)

Portfolio (portfolio.html)

Final architecture (conflicts resolved):

Top: Autoplay-only slideshow (non-interactive)

Bottom: Thumbnail gallery

Glass applies ONLY to slideshow

Gallery has NO glass (performance decision)

Slideshow

Autoplay

Fade transitions

Image counter

No clicking / navigation

Uses sequential filenames:

images/Collection/Slides/slide-1.webp
slide-2.webp
...

Gallery

Responsive CSS grid

Lazy loading + IntersectionObserver

Clicking thumbnail opens lightbox

Lightbox

Full-screen modal

ESC / backdrop / close button supported

⚠️ Gallery-grid-only or full-gallery-only designs were explicitly abandoned due to performance issues.

Order Flows

Quick Print (print-ready)

Large Projects / Wraps (proof-required)

Pricing Rules (Locked)

6. Image Strategy (Final)

Originals preserved separately for print

CSS + inline background paths updated to .webp

Portfolio JS supports WebP natively

Thumbnails recommended for performance
